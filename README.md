# Ocean Plastics Demo

This app is part of a [Chapman University Grand Challenges Initiative](https://www.chapman.edu/about/our-home/keck-center/gci/index.aspx) project
focused on ocean plastics. The app promotes upcoming nonprofit organizations and events in a sleek interface,
free of distractions found in traditional social media apps.

## Getting Started

The app is built using SwiftUI. To develop the app, you must have a Mac with [Xcode 15 or later](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) installed
along with one or more iPhone simulators.

Start by cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/brendan-ch/OceanPlasticsDemo
$ cd OceanPlasticsDemo
```

Then, open the project in Xcode:

```
$ xed OceanPlasticsDemo.xcodeproj
```

Or, navigate to the project directory in Finder, and double-click the `.xcodeproj` file.
